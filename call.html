CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
----------------------------------------------------------

VVV 2014, the Ninth iCub Summer School

Aim:
The iCub Summer School, "Veni Vidi Vici", serves to
consolidate and disseminate skills in software engineering
for humanoid robots. Our goal is to foster long-lived
academic collaboration on robot software across the
boundaries and lifetimes of individual projects. 
The iCub summer school is a peer-to-peer event; there are 
no lectures, and no strict division of instructors and 
students. All participants are expected to be competent 
C/C++ programmers with an interest in working
with others (and an agenda of their own). The school
schedule will be organized flexibly around informal
tutorials from participants on modules they are working on
or interested in.

Format:
The school is structured as a series of hands-on practical
laboratory sessions, and informal talks.  Two full iCub 
humanoids will be available for participants to work with.
We will have a dedicated local network, with wireless. 
Participants are expected to bring their own laptop.

Topics:
Motor control, robot design, image processing,
communication, software engineering, machine learning,
free software, open-source hardware.

Location:
This year the school will be hosted at the Mediaterraneo
Foundation in Sestri Levante, Liguria, Italy.  See the
school website for venue details.  Comments on this venue
